% Seminal papers:
 
%  - ultra-large docking (AmpC and D4)
%  - MT1 and sigma-1 receptor
%  - V-SYNTHES

% Review papers:
% 	- review of different chemical spaces
% 		- all on-demand spaces are combinatorial
% 		- enumerated spaces are probably not, but synthesisability may vary
% 	- "ultra-large" cheminformatics review
% 		- similarity and pharmacophore searches are already relatively fast
% 	- Shoichet's guide to large-scale docking campaings 

% Technical papers
%  - deep docking
%  	- first of its kind
%  	- large database
%  	- first showed substantial reduction (median 20x)
%  	- heavy model (Keras + V100 GPU)
%  - de Graaf et al
%  	- tried not only docking but some QM
%  	- explored recommending systems approaches
%  - Shoichet group paper (2021)
%  	- also heavy model (DeepChem)
%  - preprint about logistic regression
%  	- tried different fingerprints
%  	- compared themselves with de Graaf et al 
%  	- probably first lightweight model
%  - lean docking
%  	- not really interesting
%  	- lightweight model
%  	- don't talk about "virtual hits"

% Other approaches:
% 	- generative modelling (cite some review)
% 	- genetic algorithms 
% 	- v-synthes + biosolveit's similar approach

% Why are we interesting:
% 	- compare different "classical" models
% 	- "explore" exploration-exploitation tradeoff using docking inaccuarcy (many other papers point that out)
% 	- show two different docking algorithms
% 	- prove that lightweight models are very good
% 	- show "upper bound" for the model
% 	- we measure time and compare it to actual docking
