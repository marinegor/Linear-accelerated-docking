% Fig 6: TSNE of linear regression

% Some points to make:
% 	- TODO: need to compare performance on D4 and AmpC in "large" mode (like fig. 6 from logistic regression preprint)
% 	- TODO: we still get diverse datasets (BM scaffolds vs iteration)
% 	- linear models actually do "exploitation-exploration" balance really good: UMAP/tSNE of linear regression coefficients
% 	- LM can be trained and inferenced without significant memory and CPU consumption and are practically simplest possible models
% 	- LM are independent of library construction principle (v-synthes and other modern libraries)
% 	- fingerprints and structures can be pre-computed
% 	- can be run on a server without GPU

% Fig 7: comparison with other papers
% 	- A: "iterations" mode with some points marked
% 	- B: table/histogram/pie chart/whatever with time estimations
