\section{Data and Software availability}
Docking scores, obtained with ICM-Pro and used in this study, are available in Supplementary materials. We used Molsoft ICM 3.9-1b for docking and chemfp 1.6.1 for fingerprint preparation. We used sklearn 0.23.2 for model training and inference. Jupyter notebooks and scripts, used for model training and inference, as well as for plotting are available at github.com/marinegor/linear-accelerated-docking.
