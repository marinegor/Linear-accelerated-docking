	abstract     = {Drug discovery is a rigorous process that requires billion dollars of investments and decades of research to bring a molecule “from bench to a bedside”. While virtual docking can signiﬁcantly accelerate the process of drug discovery, it ultimately lags the current rate of expansion of chemical databases that already exceed billions of molecular records. This recent surge of small molecules availability presents great drug discovery opportunities, but also demands much faster screening protocols. In order to address this challenge, we herein introduce Deep Docking (DD), a novel deep learning platform that is suitable for docking billions of molecular structures in a rapid, yet accurate fashion. The DD approach utilizes quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) deep models trained on docking scores of subsets of a chemical library to approximate the docking outcome for yet unprocessed entries and, therefore, to remove unfavorable molecules in an iterative manner. The use of DD methodology in conjunction with the FRED docking program allowed rapid and accurate calculation of docking scores for 1.36 billion molecules from the ZINC15 library against 12 prominent target proteins and demonstrated up to 100-fold data reduction and 6000-fold enrichment of high scoring molecules (without notable loss of favorably docked entities). The DD protocol can readily be used in conjunction with any docking program and was made publicly available.},

	abstract     = {While small molecule internal strain is crucial to molecular docking, using it in evaluating ligand scores has remained elusive. Here, we investigate a technique that calculates strain using relative torsional populations in the Cambridge Structural Database, enabling fast precalculation of these energies. In retrospective studies of large docking screens of the dopamine D4 receptor and of AmpC β-lactamase, where close to 600 docking hits were tested experimentally, including such strain energies improved hit rates by preferentially reducing the ranks of strained high-scoring decoy molecules. In a 40-target subset of the DUD-E benchmark, we found two thresholds that usefully distinguished between ligands and decoys: one based on the total strain energy of the small molecules and another based on the maximum strain allowed for any given torsion within them. Using these criteria, about 75\% of the benchmark targets had improved enrichment after strain ﬁltering. Relying on precalculated population distributions, this approach is rapid, taking less than 0.04 s to evaluate a conformation on a standard core, making it pragmatic for precalculating strain in even ultralarge libraries. Since it is scoring function agnostic, it may be useful to multiple docking approaches; it is openly available at http://tldr.docking.org.},

We present examples of chemical libraries and spaces and the means used to construct them, and we discuss new technologies for searching huge libraries and for searching combinatorially in chemical space. We also cover space navigation techniques and consider new approaches to de novo drug design and the impact of the “autonomous laboratory” on synthesis of designed compounds.

We describe here a high-throughput virtual screening project using 3D similarity (FastROCS) and automated evaluation workﬂows on Orion, a cloud computing platform. Cloud resources make this approach fully scalable and ﬂexible, allowing the generation and search of billions of virtual molecules, and give access to an explicit 3D virtual chemistry space not available before.

The current heterogeneity in evaluation techniques and metrics leads to difficulty in (or the impossibility of) comparing and assessing the relevance of new algorithms. Ultimately, this may delay the digitalization of chemistry at scale and confuse method developers, experimentalists, reviewers and journal editors. In this Perspective, we critically discuss a set of method development and evaluation guidelines for different types of ML-based publications, emphasizing supervised learning. We provide a diverse collection of examples from various authors and disciplines in chemistry. While taking into account varying accessibility across research groups, our recommendations focus on reporting completeness and standardizing comparisons between tools. We aim to further contribute to improved ML transparency and credibility by suggesting a checklist of retro-/prospective tests and dissecting their importance. We envisage that the wide adoption and continuous update of best practices will encourage an informed use of ML on real-world problems related to the chemical sciences.},

	abstract     = {Commercial make-on-demand compound spaces have become increasingly popular within the past few years. Since these libraries are too large for enumeration, they are usually accessed using combinatorial fragment space technologies like FTrees-FS and SpaceLight. Although both search types are of high practical impact, they lack the ability to search for precise structural features on the atomic level. To address this important use case, we developed SpaceMACS enabling eﬃcient and precise maximum common induced substructure (MCIS) similarity and substructure searches within chemical fragment spaces. SpaceMACS enumerates a user-deﬁned number of compounds in a multistep procedure. First, substructures of the query are extracted and matched to all fragments of the space. Then partial results are combined to actual compounds of the space. In this way, SpaceMACS identiﬁes common substructures even if they cross fragment borders. We applied SpaceMACS on three commercial fragment spaces searching for the 150 000 most similar analogs to a glucosyltransferase binder from literature. We were able to ﬁnd almost all building blocks used for the synthesis of the 90 listed analogs and a plethora of additional results. SpaceMACS is the missing link to enable rational drug discovery on make-on-demand combinatorial catalogs. No matter whether initial compound suggestions come from a de novo design, an AI-based compound generation, or a medicinal chemist’s drawing board, the method gives access to the structurally closest chemically available analogs in seconds to at most minutes.},

In cases where the library of molecules is exceedingly large, the cost of an exhaustive virtual screen may be prohibitive. Model-guided optimization has been employed to lower these costs through dramatic increases in sample efficiency compared to random selection. However, these techniques introduce new costs to the workflow through the surrogate model training and inference steps. In this study, we propose an extension to the framework of model-guided optimization that mitigates inferences costs using a technique we refer to as design space pruning (DSP), which irreversibly removes poor-performing candidates from consideration. We study the application of DSP to a variety of optimization tasks and observe significant reductions in overhead costs while exhibiting similar performance to the baseline optimization. DSP represents an attractive extension of model-guided optimization that can limit overhead costs in optimization settings where these costs are non-negligible relative to objective costs, such as docking.},

Here synthons are deﬁned as actual fragments with valid valences and special labels, specifying the position and the nature of reactive centers. They can be issued from either the “breakup” of reference compounds according to 38 retrosynthetic rules or real reagents, after leaving group withdrawal or transformation. Such an approach not only enables the design of synthetically accessible libraries and analog generation but also facilitates reagents (building blocks) analysis in the medicinal chemistry context.

The design phase is usually carried out via traditional medicinal chemistry approaches and/or structure-based drug design (SBDD) when suitable structural information is available. Two of the major limitations of this approach are (1) diﬃculty in rapidly designing potent molecules that adhere to myriad project criteria, or the multiparameter optimization (MPO) problem, and (2) the relatively small number of molecules explored compared to the vast size of chemical space. To address these limitations, we have developed AutoDesigner, a de novo design algorithm. AutoDesigner employs a cloud-native, multistage search algorithm to carry out successive rounds of chemical space exploration and ﬁltering. Millions to billions of virtual molecules are explored and optimized while adhering to a customizable set of project criteria such as physicochemical properties and potency. Additionally, the algorithm only requires a single ligand with measurable aﬃnity and a putative binding model as a starting point, making it amenable to the early stages of an SBDD project where limited data are available. To assess the eﬀectiveness of AutoDesigner, we applied it to the design of novel inhibitors of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), a target for the treatment of schizophrenia. AutoDesigner was able to generate and eﬃciently explore over 1 billion molecules to successfully address a variety of project goals. The compounds generated by AutoDesigner that were synthesized and assayed (1) simultaneously met not only physicochemical criteria, clearance, and central nervous system (CNS) penetration (Kp,uu) cutoﬀs but also potency thresholds and (2) fully utilize structural data to discover and explore novel interactions and a previously unexplored subpocket in the DAO active site. The reported data demonstrate that AutoDesigner can play a key role in accelerating the discovery of novel, potent chemical matter within the constraints of a given drug discovery lead optimization campaign.},

Today’s screening libraries are larger and more diverse, enabling the discovery of more-potent hit compounds and unlocking new areas of chemical space, represented by new core scaﬀolds. Applying physics-based in silico screening methods in an exhaustive manner, where every molecule in the library must be enumerated and evaluated independently, is increasingly cost-prohibitive. Here, we introduce a protocol for machine learning-enhanced molecular docking based on active learning to dramatically increase throughput over traditional docking. We leverage a novel selection protocol that strikes a balance between two objectives: (1) identifying the best scoring compounds and (2) exploring a large region of chemical space, demonstrating superior performance compared to a purely greedy approach. Together with automated redocking of the top compounds, this method captures almost all the high scoring scaﬀolds in the library found by exhaustive docking. This protocol is applied to our recent virtual screening campaigns against the D4 and AMPC targets that produced dozens of highly potent, novel inhibitors, and a blind test against the MT1 target. Our protocol recovers more than 80\% of the experimentally conﬁrmed hits with a 14-fold reduction in compute cost, and more than 90\% of the hit scaﬀolds in the top 5\% of model predictions, preserving the diversity of the experimentally conﬁrmed hit compounds.},

Because it is computationally diﬃcult, docking is time-consuming and any docking user will eventually encounter a chemical library that is too big to dock. This problem might arise because there is not enough computing power or because preparing and storing so many three-dimensional (3D) ligands requires too much space. In this study, however, we show that quality regressors can be trained to predict docking scores from molecular ﬁngerprints. Although typical docking has a screening rate of less than one ligand per second on one CPU core, our regressors can predict about 5800 docking scores per second. This approach allows us to focus docking on the portion of a database that is predicted to have docking scores below a user-chosen threshold. Herein, usage examples are shown, where only 25\% of a ligand database is docked, without any signiﬁcant virtual screening performance loss. We call this method “lean-docking”. To validate lean-docking, a massive docking campaign using several state-of-the-art docking software packages was undertaken on an unbiased data set, with only wet-lab tested active and inactive molecules. Although regressors allow the screening of a larger chemical space, even at a constant docking power, it is also clear that signiﬁcant progress in the virtual screening power of docking scores is desirable.},

		Bayesian optimization can accelerate structure-based virtual screening campaigns by minimizing the total number of simulations performed while still identifying the vast majority of computational hits. ,

		Structure-based virtual screening is an important tool in early stage drug discovery that scores the interactions between a target protein and candidate ligands. As virtual libraries continue to grow (in excess of 10 8 molecules), so too do the resources necessary to conduct exhaustive virtual screening campaigns on these libraries. However, Bayesian optimization techniques, previously employed in other scientific discovery problems, can aid in their exploration: a surrogate structure–property relationship model trained on the predicted affinities of a subset of the library can be applied to the remaining library members, allowing the least promising compounds to be excluded from evaluation. In this study, we explore the application of these techniques to computational docking datasets and assess the impact of surrogate model architecture, acquisition function, and acquisition batch size on optimization performance. We observe significant reductions in computational costs; for example, using a directed-message passing neural network we can identify 94.8\% or 89.3\% of the top-50 000 ligands in a 100M member library after testing only 2.4\% of candidate ligands using an upper confidence bound or greedy acquisition strategy, respectively. Such model-guided searches mitigate the increasing computational costs of screening increasingly large virtual libraries and can accelerate high-throughput virtual screening campaigns with applications beyond docking.

By the combined use of functional group filters and a score modifier based on a heuristic synthetic accessibility (SA) score our approach identifies between ca 500 and 6,000 structurally diverse molecules with scores better than known binders by screening a total of 400,000 molecules starting from 8,000 randomly selected molecules from the ZINC database. Screening 250,000 molecules from the ZINC database identifies significantly more molecules with better docking scores than known binders, with the exception of CM, where the conventional screening approach only identifies 60 compounds compared to 511 with GA+Filter+SA. In the case of β2AR and DDR1, the GA+Filter+SA approach finds significantly more molecules with docking scores lower than −9.0 and −10.0. The GA+Filters+SA docking methodology is thus effective in generating a large and diverse set of synthetically accessible molecules with very good docking scores for a particular target. An early incarnation of the GA+Filter+SA approach was used to identify potential binders to the COVID-19 main protease and submitted to the early stages of the COVID Moonshot project, a crowd-sourced initiative to accelerate the development of a COVID antiviral.},

		Abstract

		With the ever-increasing number of synthesis-on-demand compounds for drug lead discovery, there is a great need for efficient search technologies. We present the successful application of a virtual screening method that combines two advances: (1) it avoids full library enumeration (2) products are evaluated by molecular docking, leveraging protein structural information. Crucially, these advances enable a structure-based technique that can efficiently explore libraries with billions of molecules and beyond. We apply this method to identify inhibitors of ROCK1 from almost one billion commercially available compounds. Out of 69 purchased compounds, 27 (39\%) have K i values {\textless} 10 µM. X-ray structures of two leads confirm their docked poses. This approach to docking scales roughly with the number of reagents that span a chemical space and is therefore multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional docking.

Crystallographic fragment screening is a strategy based on elucidating binding modes of small polar compounds and then building potency by expanding or merging them. Recent advances in high-throughput crystallography enable screening of large fragment libraries, reading out dense ensembles of fragments spanning the binding site. However, fragments typically have low affinity thus the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Here, we take advantage of high-throughput crystallography to reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem – identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from a fragment ensemble amid noise due to weak binders – and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. Our method screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We retrospectively validated our approach on an open science campaign against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), showing that our method can distinguish active compounds from inactive ones using only structural data of fragment-protein complexes, without any activity data. Further, we prospectively found novel hits for Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3. More broadly, our results demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning helps interpret high throughput crystallography data to rapidly discover of potent chemical modulators of protein function.},

We benchmarked our system by screening 50 million HAC 22 molecules against the DRD4 receptor. We saw up to 3-fold variations in cost between AWS availability zones. Docking 4.5 billion lead-like molecules, a 7-week calculation on our 1000-core lab cluster, runs in less than a week in AWS for around \$25,000, less than the cost of two new nodes. The cloud docking protocol is described in easy-to-follow steps and may be sufficiently general to be used for other docking programs. All the tools to enable AWS-DOCK are available free to everyone, while DOCK 3.8 is free for academic research.},

With that, there emerged a trend of a significant democratization of CADD that contributed to the rapid development of various COVID-19 drug candidates currently undergoing different stages of validation. On the other hand, this democratization also inadvertently led to the surge rapidly performed molecular docking studies to nominate multiple scores of novel drug candidates supported by computational arguments only. Albeit driven by best intentions, most of such studies also did not follow best practices in the field that require experience and expertise learned through multiple rigorously designed benchmarking studies and rigorous experimental validation. In this Viewpoint we reflect on recent disbalance between small number of rigorous and comprehensive studies and the proliferation of purely computational studies enabled by the ease of docking software availability. We further elaborate on the hyped oversale of CADD methods’ ability to rapidly yield viable drug candidates and reiterate the critical importance of rigor and adherence to the best practices of CADD in view of recent emergence of AI and Big Data in the field.},

We demonstrate that one can substantially improve the accuracy of these predictions using easily obtained data about completely different molecules that bind to the same target without requiring any target-bound structures of these molecules. The approach we developed to integrate physical and data-driven modeling may find a variety of applications in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence for drug discovery. , Over the past five decades, tremendous effort has been devoted to computational methods for predicting properties of ligands—i.e., molecules that bind macromolecular targets. Such methods, which are critical to rational drug design, fall into two categories: physics-based methods, which directly model ligand interactions with the target given the target’s three-dimensional (3D) structure, and ligand-based methods, which predict ligand properties given experimental measurements for similar ligands. Here, we present a rigorous statistical framework to combine these two sources of information. We develop a method to predict a ligand’s pose—the 3D structure of the ligand bound to its target—that leverages a widely available source of information: a list of other ligands that are known to bind the same target but for which no 3D structure is available. This combination of physics-based and ligand-based modeling improves pose prediction accuracy across all major families of drug targets. Using the same framework, we develop a method for virtual screening of drug candidates, which outperforms standard physics-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods. Our results suggest broad opportunities to improve prediction of various ligand properties by combining diverse sources of information through customized machine-learning approaches.},

		Abstract

		Proteasome substrate receptor hRpn13 is a promising anti-cancer target. By integrated in silico and biophysical screening, we identified a chemical scaffold that binds hRpn13 with non-covalent interactions that mimic the proteasome and a weak electrophile for Michael addition. hRpn13 Pru domain binds proteasomes and ubiquitin whereas its DEUBAD domain binds deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL5. NMR revealed lead compound XL5 to interdigitate into a hydrophobic pocket created by lateral movement of a Pru β-hairpin with an exposed end for Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Implementing XL5 -PROTACs as chemical probes identified a DEUBAD-lacking hRpn13 species (hRpn13 Pru ) present naturally with cell type-dependent abundance. XL5 -PROTACs preferentially target hRpn13 Pru , causing its ubiquitination. Gene-editing and rescue experiments established hRpn13 requirement for XL5 -PROTAC-triggered apoptosis. These data establish hRpn13 as an anti-cancer target for multiple myeloma and introduce an hRpn13-targeting scaffold that can be optimized for preclinical trials against hRpn13 Pru -producing cancer types.

	abstract     = {Molecular conformation generation (MCG) is a fundamental and important problem in drug discovery. Many traditional methods have been developed to solve the MCG problem, such as systematic searching, model-building, random searching, distance geometry, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo methods etc. However, they have some limitations depending on the molecular structures. Recently, there are plenty of deep learning based MCG methods, which claim they largely outperform the traditional methods. However, to our surprise, we design a simple and cheap algorithm (parameter-free) based on the traditional methods and ﬁnd it is comparable to or even outperforms deep learning based MCG methods in the widely used GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmarks. In particular, our design algorithm is simply the clustering of the RDKit-generated conformations. We hope our ﬁndings can help the community to revise the deep learning methods for MCG. The code of the proposed algorithm could be found at https://gist.github. com/ZhouGengmo/5b565f51adafcd911c0bc115b2ef027c.},

	abstract     = {Molecular docking, given a ligand molecule and a ligand binding site (called “pocket”) on a protein, predicting the binding mode of the protein-ligand complex, is a widely used technique in drug design. Many deep learning models have been developed for molecular docking, while most existing deep learning models perform docking on the whole protein, rather than on a given pocket as the traditional molecular docking approaches, which does not match common needs. What’s more, they claim to perform better than traditional molecular docking, but the approach of comparison is not fair, since traditional methods are not designed for docking on the whole protein without a given pocket. In this paper, we design a series of experiments to examine the actual performance of these deep learning models and traditional methods. For a fair comparison, we decompose the docking on the whole protein into two steps, pocket searching and docking on a given pocket, and build pipelines to evaluate traditional methods and deep learning methods respectively. We ﬁnd that deep learning models are actually good at pocket searching, but traditional methods are better than deep learning models at docking on given pockets. Overall, our work explicitly reveals some potential problems in current deep learning models for molecular docking and provides several suggestions for future works.},

However, their development is complicated by the numerous photophysical and biological properties that must be simultaneously optimized. To accelerate the design of photoactive drugs, we describe a procedure that combines ligand-protein docking with chemical property prediction based on machine learning (ML). We apply this procedure to 58 proteins and 9,000 photo-drug candidates based on azobenzene cis–trans isomerism. We ﬁnd that most proteins display a preference for trans isomers over cis, and that the binding aﬃnities of nominally active/inactive pairs are in fact highly correlated. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant value for photopharmacology research, and reinforce the need for virtual screening to identify compounds with rare desirable properties. Further, we combine our procedure with quantum chemical validation to identify promising candidates for the photoactive inhibition of PARP1, an enzyme that is over-expressed in cancer cells. The top compounds are predicted to have long-lived active forms, diﬀerential bioactivity, and absorption in the near-infrared therapeutic window.},

In addition, the most sophisticated methods, e.g., those based on configurational sampling by molecular dynamics, require significant pre- and postprocessing to provide a final ranking, which hinders straightforward applications by nonexpert users. We present a novel computational platform named ChemFlow to bridge the gap between 2D chemical libraries and estimated protein–ligand binding affinities. The software is designed to prepare a library of compounds provided in SMILES or SDF format, dock them into the protein binding site, and rescore the poses by simplified free energy calculations. Using a data set of 626 protein–ligand complexes and GPU computing, we demonstrate that ChemFlow provides relative binding free energies with an RMSE {\textless} 2 kcal/mol at a rate of 1000 ligands per day on a midsize computer cluster.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) orchestrated by active learning (AL) in an AL–AutoML workflow allows unbiased and efficient search for a small set of best-performing molecules. We have applied this workflow to select inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and were able to find 133 compounds with improved binding affinity, including 16 compounds with better than 100-fold binding affinity improvement. We obtained a hit rate that outperforms that expected of traditional expert medicinal chemist-guided campaigns.

Here we investigate structure-based docking of a bespoke virtual library of tetrahydropyridines—a scaffold that is poorly sampled by a general billion-molecule virtual library but is well suited to many aminergic G-protein-coupled receptors. Using three inputs, each with diverse available derivatives, a one pot C–H alkenylation, electrocyclization and reduction provides the tetrahydropyridine core with up to six sites of derivatization5–7. Docking a virtual library of 75 million tetrahydropyridines against a model of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) led to the synthesis and testing of 17 initial molecules. Four of these molecules had low-micromolar activities against either the 5-HT2A or the 5-HT2B receptors. Structure-based optimization led to the 5-HT2AR agonists (R)-69 and (R)-70, with half-maximal effective concentration values of 41 nM and 110 nM, respectively, and unusual signalling kinetics that differ from psychedelic 5-HT2AR agonists. Cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis confirmed the predicted binding mode to 5-HT2AR. The favourable physical properties of these new agonists conferred high brain permeability, enabling mouse behavioural assays. Notably, neither had psychedelic activity, in contrast to classic 5-HT2AR agonists, whereas both had potent antidepressant activity in mouse models and had the same efficacy as antidepressants such as fluoxetine at as low as 1/40th of the dose. Prospects for using bespoke virtual libraries to sample pharmacologically relevant chemical space will be considered.},

These structures templated a large-scale docking screen of 490 million virtual molecules, of which 484 compounds were synthesized and tested. We identified 127 new chemotypes with affinities superior to 1 μM, 31 of which had affinities superior to 50 nM. The hit rate fell smoothly and monotonically with docking score. We optimized three hits for potency and selectivity, and achieved affinities that ranged from 3 to 48 nM, with up to 250-fold selectivity versus the σ1 receptor. Crystal structures of two ligands bound to the σ2 receptor confirmed the docked poses. To investigate the contribution of the σ2 receptor in pain, two potent σ2-selective ligands and one potent σ1/σ2 non-selective ligand were tested for efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. All three ligands showed time-dependent decreases in mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury model9, suggesting that the σ2 receptor has a role in nociception.

In part, this is due to expensive and time-consuming wet-laboratory experiments, poor initial hit compounds and the high attrition rates in the (pre-)clinical phases. Structure-based virtual screening has the potential to mitigate these problems. With structure-based virtual screening, the quality of the hits improves with the number of compounds screened2. However, despite the fact that large databases of compounds exist, the ability to carry out large-scale structure-based virtual screening on computer clusters in an accessible, efficient and flexible manner has remained difficult. Here we describe VirtualFlow, a highly automated and versatile open-source platform with perfect scaling behaviour that is able to prepare and efficiently screen ultra-large libraries of compounds. VirtualFlow is able to use a variety of the most powerful docking programs. Using VirtualFlow, we prepared one of the largest and freely available ready-to-dock ligand libraries, with more than 1.4 billion commercially available molecules. To demonstrate the power of VirtualFlow, we screened more than 1 billion compounds and identified a set of structurally diverse molecules that bind to KEAP1 with submicromolar affinity. One of the lead inhibitors (iKeap1) engages KEAP1 with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) = 114 nM) and disrupts the interaction between KEAP1 and the transcription factor NRF2. This illustrates the potential of VirtualFlow to access vast regions of the chemical space and identify molecules that bind with high affinity to target proteins.},

	abstract     = {The neuromodulator melatonin synchronizes circadian rhythms and related physiological functions through the actions of two G-protein-coupled receptors: MT1 and MT2. Circadian release of melatonin at night from the pineal gland activates melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizing the physiology and behaviour of animals to the light–dark cycle1–4. The two receptors are established drug targets for aligning circadian phase to this cycle in disorders of sleep5,6 and depression1–4,7–9. Despite their importance, few in vivo active MT1-selective ligands have been reported2,8,10–12, hampering both the understanding of circadian biology and the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we docked more than 150 million virtual molecules to an MT1 crystal structure, prioritizing structural fit and chemical novelty. Of these compounds, 38 high-ranking molecules were synthesized and tested, revealing ligands with potencies ranging from 470 picomolar to 6 micromolar. Structure-based optimization led to two selective MT1 inverse agonists—which were topologically unrelated to previously explored chemotypes—that acted as inverse agonists in a mouse model of circadian re-entrainment. Notably, we found that these MT1-selective inverse agonists advanced the phase of the mouse circadian clock by 1.3–1.5 h when given at subjective dusk, an agonist-like effect that was eliminated in MT1- but not in MT2-knockout mice. This study illustrates the opportunities for modulating melatonin receptor biology through MT1-selective ligands and for the discovery of previously undescribed, in vivo active chemotypes from structure-based screens of diverse, ultralarge libraries.},

	abstract     = {Two major components are required for a successful prediction of the three-dimensional structure of peptides and proteins: an efficient global optimization procedure which is capable of finding an appropriate local minimum for the strongly anisotropic function of hundreds of variables, and a set of free energy components for a protein molecule in solution which are computationally inexpensive enough to be used in the search procedure, yet sufficiently accurate to ensure the uniqueness of the native conformation. We here found an efficient way to make a random step in a Monte Carlo procedure given knowledge of the energy or statistical properties of conformational subspaces (e.g. φ-ψ zones or side-chain torsion angles). This biased probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure randomly selects the subspace first, then makes a step to a new random position independent of the previous position, but according to the predefined continuous probability distribution. The random step is followed by a local minimization in torsion angle space. The positions, sizes and preferences for high-probability zones on φ-ψ maps and χ-angle maps were calculated for different residue types from the representative set of 191 and 161 protein 3D-structures, respectively. A fast and precise method to evaluate the electrostatic energy of a protein in solution is developed and combined with the BPMC procedure. The method is based on the modified spherical image charge approximation, efficiently projected onto a molecule of arbitrary shape. Comparison with the finite-difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation shows high accuracy for our approach. The BPMC procedure is applied successfully to the structure prediction of 12- and 16-residue synthetic peptides and the determination of protein structure from NMR data, with the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G as an example. The BPMC runs display much better convergence properties than the non-biased simulations. The advantage of a true global optimization procedure for NMR structure determination is its ability to cope with local minima originating from data errors and ambiguities in NMR data.},

CysLT1R antagonists have been widely used to treat asthma disorders, while CysLT2R is a potential target against uveal melanoma. However, very few selective antagonist chemotypes for CysLT receptors are available, and the design of such ligands has proved to be challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we took advantage of recently solved crystal structures of CysLT receptors and an ultra-large Enamine REAL library, representing a chemical space of 680 M readily available compounds. Virtual ligand screening employed 4D docking models comprising crystal structures of CysLT1R and CysLT2R and their corresponding ligand-optimized models. Functional assessment of the candidate hits yielded discovery of five novel antagonist chemotypes with sub-micromolar potencies and the best Ki = 220 nM at CysLT1R. One of the hits showed inverse agonism at the L129Q constitutively active mutant of CysLT2R, with potential utility against uveal melanoma.},

	abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are important therapeutic targets. During the last decade, the number of atomic-resolution structures of GPCRs has increased rapidly, providing insights into drug binding at the molecular level. These breakthroughs have created excitement regarding the potential of using structural information in ligand design and initiated a new era of rational drug discovery for GPCRs. The molecular docking method is now widely applied to model the three-dimensional structures of GPCR-ligand complexes and screen for chemical probes in large compound libraries. In this review article, we first summarize the current structural coverage of the GPCR superfamily and the understanding of receptor-ligand interactions at atomic resolution. We then present the general workflow of structure-based virtual screening and strategies to discover GPCR ligands in chemical libraries. We assess the state of the art of this research field by summarizing prospective applications of virtual screening based on experimental structures. Strategies to identify compounds with specific efficacy and selectivity profiles are discussed, illustrating the opportunities and limitations of the molecular docking method. Our overview shows that structure-based virtual screening can discover novel leads and will be essential in pursuing the next generation of GPCR drugs. Significance Statement Extraordinary advances in the structural biology of G protein–coupled receptors have revealed the molecular details of ligand recognition by this large family of therapeutic targets, providing novel avenues for rational drug design. Structure-based docking is an efficient computational approach to identify novel chemical probes from large compound libraries, which has the potential to accelerate the development of drug candidates.},
